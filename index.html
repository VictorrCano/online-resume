        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>"We see a lot of interns in our internship program. Victor stands out as one of our best. 
            He came to work on time, worked well with others, and was a reliable team member. 
            He was eager to learn and willingly threw himself at new problems to help out his team. 
            Victor is on his way to being a great software engineer." - Andrew Siemer, Inventive Works CEO</p>
